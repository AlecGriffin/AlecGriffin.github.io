**What are your expectations of the class?**
      Coming into this class, I expect to learn the various principles in software engineering and the various tools
      they use to aid them in producing robust software. I have heard from previous students I know who have taken this class 
      that you gain useful knowledge in developing full stack applications and I look forward to gaining a more complete 
      understanding of all the aspects of a Web Application.

**What did you do this past week?**

      This past week consisted mainly of acclimating myself to my new schedule and settling into a new house with my roomates in North Campus. It wasn't too busy of a week, but I'm sure things will pick up quickly now that classes have gone over their syllabi and class expectations.

**What's in your way?**

      Finding a full time position for after college while maintaining my school work and extracurricular activities is the         biggest challenge I will face this semester.

**What will you do next week?**

      This next next week will be about setting good habits for the rest of the semester and about finalizing my schedule. 

**What's my experience of the class?**

      I don't have much to say being that its only week 1, but I have enjoyed the class format thus far and look forward having Professor Downing for a second time having previously his Object Oriented Programming class.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
