**What did you do this past week?**

My project group, GameDayBallers, finished up IDB2. We were able to meet all of the project requirements when building our project fully in react. I completely recreated our project using the npm package 'create-react-app' which made Webpack work behind the scenes and made working with React much easier.   


**What's in your way?**

Make up work. I had to put off work from other classes due to the project and need to catch up now. It shouldn't be too much of a problem because thankfully my week is pretty light.


**What will you do next week?**

The week is more relaxed than most and I will spend most of the time catching up on work from other classes that I'be had to put off.


**What's my experience of the class?**

The workload of the projects can be intensive, but it really does force you to get very familiar with tools that you may have never used before. I've enjoyed learning about web development especially since I've never spent any time learning the technologies or methodologies behind it.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

Spend some time at the beginning of each project worrying about structure and overall design. You don't have to obsess over it, but starting with a solid foundation can make a project much less time consuming and easier to deal with once it starts to grow in size.
